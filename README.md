# ☕ Java Basics & DSA Practice Repository

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains my learning journey in **Core Java** and **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**.
It includes practice programs, concept-based examples, and small problem-solving files organized topic-wise for easy understanding.

The goal of this repository is to:

* Strengthen Java fundamentals
* Practice problem-solving
* Build a strong base for DSA and interviews
